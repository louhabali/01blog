Is error handling present on both backend and frontend?
Are database relationships (e.g., users, posts, comments, reports) correctly set up?
Are reports on profiles/posts saved with reasons and timestamps?
Is all input sanitized to prevent SQL injection or XSS attacks?
Are all actions (post/report/subscribe) confirmed with visual feedback?
Are uploaded files retrievable without corruption?
