++++++++++++ Reactive Primitives (Data Sources)
@Observable:
A lazy stream of data. It only begins emitting values when an observer explicitly
calls .subscribe(). (The data producer is dormant until someone asks for it.)

@BehaviorSubject:
A "hot" Observable that always holds the current value. 
New subscribers immediately receive this last value, plus all future values. (Used for current state.)

@ReplaySubject: 
A "hot" Observable that buffers past values (configured by size).
New subscribers receive the buffered history upon connection. (Used for data history/context.)

@Signals (Angular): 
A framework-native container for a single, mutable value. 
Updated via .set() or .update(), guaranteeing direct, optimized UI reactivity without subscriptions.

++++++++++++ RxJS Operators (Data Pipeline)
@Pipe: 
The method used to compose and sequence multiple operators, creating a processing chain for the Observable stream.

@Map: 
The operator that transforms each emitted value into a new value. (Alters the data content.)

@Tap: 
The operator used to execute side effects (e.g., logging, setting state) 
without modifying the value that continues down the stream. (Observes, but doesn't change the data.)
